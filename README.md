This is a copy of yii-chinese, originally published under an MIT-style licence on https://code.google.com/p/yii-chinese by [jerry2...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110206548434750904547/).

As I understand it, this is a library for the Yii PHP framework to transcode between various encodings of Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, Pinyin and UTF-8. However, I do not read Chinese so I may be mistaken. Original documentation below.

This is not my software. It is provided here for reference, as Google Code will be closing and I have found the Unicode tables in this project useful. I do not take credit for yii-chinese and neither do I support it.

目前该类库可以实现，简体中文 <=> 繁体中文编码互换，简体中文、繁体中文 => 拼音单向转换，简体中文、繁体中文 <=> UTF8 编码转换，简体中文、繁体中文 => Unicode单向转换
